Welcome to this course on VHDL.

You just sent your first e-mail to <vhdlabgabe+e384@tuwien.ac.at>. This way
you subscribed to this part of the course. Very shortly you will receive
an e-mail with your first task. But to start you need to know a little
more than just the task. Most importantely: all e-mails sent to this
address are automatically handled by me, a stupid little computer program.

In order to submit your results, you need to know how to communicate with
me. I only accept specially formatted emails, notably the subject has to
be formatted in one of the following ways:

Results:
   If you want to commit a result, the Subject of your email has to contain
   the string "result" as well as the task this submission is concerning.
   So for example, if you want to submit results for Task1 your subject
   could be "Result Task1" or "I am Submitting my ReSuLtS for TAsk1"
   the exact phrase does not matter, only that some form of the string
   "result" and "task1" are in the subject.

Status:
   If you want to know your current status in the course (what tasks did
   you complete, how many points do you have, etc.), just send an e-mail
   in which the subject contains the word "Status".

Questions:
   If you have any questions that are not answered by the e-mails sent by
   me, you can send me an e-mail that contains the string "question" in the
   subject line. If you do so, I will redirect your e-mail to a human being
   who will take care of it as soon as possible (this might take a couple of
   days though!)

Other:
   If your subject does not follow the above explained rules, I will send
   you an e-mail similar to this one, because clearly you did not understand
   how to communicate with me.

Hope this clears things on how to communicate with me! Now I am looking
forward to hearing from you in a structured and (for me!) understandable
way!

so long, and thanks for all the fish!
