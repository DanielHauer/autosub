IMPORTANT: 
The C example tasks given in this repository are not meant for usage, as they
impose a severe security threat if used unchanged -- it means you allow everyone
who submitts to the task to execute arbitraty code on YOUR machine. These are really
just for testing.

The VHDL example tasks are meant for usage.
