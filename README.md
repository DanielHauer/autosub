Autosub implements an E-Mail based automatic submission system for E-Learning.

IMPORTANT: The examples given in this repository are not meant for usage, as they
impose a severe security threat if used unchanged -- it means you allow everyone
who submitts to the task to execute arbitraty code on YOUR machine. These are really
just for testing.
