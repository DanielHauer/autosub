The autosub requirements are created using the rmtoo requirements management
tool. This tool is open source software, and you may download it at:

https://github.com/florath/rmtoo

To build a pdf out of the rmtoo project, run the following the commands in the
current directory (the one this Readme.txt is in):

source ./setenv <path-to-rmtoo>
make

If everything works well, the result will be the file artifacts/requirements.pdf
which contains the requirements of the autosub project.
